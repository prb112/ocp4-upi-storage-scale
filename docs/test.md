# Testing
The project tests in layers - linting (valdity testing) and manual End-to-end testing.

**Test Cases**

1. Deploy a 2-node gpfs cluster and connect to an existing 4.16 cluster with 2 shared disks.

These are tested with RHEL 9.4.

Backup and Restore are beyond the purpose of this automation, and customers are expected to test/run these Non-Functional aspects as part of their operations.
